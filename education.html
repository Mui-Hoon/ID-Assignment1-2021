      <p>
        Hey, this is my homepage, so I have to say something about myself.
        Sometimes it is hard to introduce yourself because you know yourself so
        well that you do not know where to start with.
      </p>
      <section class="row">

          <p>
            I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. There are
            many things I like to do, to see, and to experience. I like to read,
            I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I
            like to listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like to
            see the moonlight at night; I like to feel the music flowing on my
            face, I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean. I like to look
            at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind, I like to do thought
            experiment when I cannot sleep in the middle of the night. I like
            flowers in spring, rain in summer, leaves in autumn, and snow in
            winter. I like to sleep early, I like to get up late; I like to be
            alone, I like to be surrounded by people. I like country’s peace, I
            like metropolis’ noise; I like the beautiful west lake in Hangzhou,
            I like the flat cornfield in Champaign. I like delicious food and
            comfortable shoes; I like good books and romantic movies. I like the
            land and the nature, I like people. And, I like to laugh.
          </p>
          <p>
            I always wanted to be a great writer, like Victor Hugo who wrote
            "Les Miserable", or like Roman Roland who wrote "John Christopher".
            They have influenced millions of people through their books. I also
            wanted to be a great psychologist, like William James or Sigmund
            Freud, who could read people’s mind. Of course, I am nowhere close
            to these people, yet. I am just someone who does some teaching, some
            research, and some writing. But my dream is still alive.
